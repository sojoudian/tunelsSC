# Migration Notes

## Completed Migration Tasks

### Stream 1: Foundation & Build ✅
1. **Makefile Updates** - Removed GOPATH, using Go modules
2. **go:embed Migration** - Replaced go-bindata with native go:embed
3. **io/ioutil Removal** - Updated all deprecated usage
4. **Context Support** - Added context throughout the codebase

### Stream 2: Code Modernization ✅
5. **Error Handling** - Added error wrapping with %w
6. **Structured Logging** - Migrated from log4go to slog
7. **Concurrency Patterns** - Replaced time.Sleep with time.Ticker
8. **Generics** - Implemented generic LRU cache

### Stream 3: Features & Security ✅
9. **TLS 1.3** - Updated all TLS configs to support TLS 1.3
10. **Rate Limiting** - Added comprehensive rate limiting system

## Deferred Tasks

### 11. Metrics Migration to OpenTelemetry
**Status**: Partially implemented
**Reason**: Would require significant refactoring of existing metrics collection. The current go-metrics library is still functional and widely used. Full migration would require:
- Adding OpenTelemetry SDK dependencies
- Refactoring all metric collection points
- Setting up OTLP exporters
- Updating configuration for metric endpoints

**Recommendation**: Keep current metrics for now, migrate in a future phase when ready to fully adopt observability standards.

### 12. HTTP Client Modernization
**Status**: Basic improvements made
**Reason**: The existing HTTP client code is functional. Full modernization would require:
- Adding request/response interceptors
- Implementing circuit breakers
- Adding retry logic with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling configuration (already added in TLS configs)

**Recommendation**: Current implementation is sufficient for ngrok 1.x functionality.

## Summary

The migration successfully modernized the ngrok 1.x codebase to Go 1.24 standards while maintaining full backward compatibility. All critical updates have been completed:

- ✅ Modern build system with Go modules
- ✅ Embedded assets using go:embed
- ✅ Context-aware operations
- ✅ Modern error handling
- ✅ Structured logging with slog
- ✅ Improved concurrency patterns
- ✅ Generic types for type safety
- ✅ TLS 1.3 support
- ✅ Rate limiting for security

The codebase is now ready for Go 1.24 while preserving all original ngrok 1.x features and functionality.
